# Bluelink

An easy-to-use CLI program to control your bluetooth.

This bluetooth manager aims to offer a simple way for users to control bluetooth connections through a CLI.
The service automatically connects to paired devices once they're available as well.
To access the CLI, simply run `$ bluelink` in your terminal.

Note: This was developed on Arch, so it might not work on all distros. Requires bluetoothctl (bluez) and systemd.
